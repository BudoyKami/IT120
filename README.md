# Django Message System

A secure and professionally designed message system built using Django, with separate apps for sending and receiving messages (`SenderApp` and `ReceiverApp`). The system supports encryption, decryption, user authentication, message management, and file attachments.

---
## Features

### SenderApp
- User registration and login system with secure password hashing.
- Send messages with:
  - Priority levels (Low, Normal, High).
  - Optional file attachments (up to 5 MB).
- Encrypted message storage using `Fernet`.
- Forward encrypted messages to `ReceiverApp`.

### ReceiverApp
- User registration and login system.
- Decrypt and store received messages.
- View, search, filter, and sort messages by sender, priority, and timestamp.
- Download attachments for received messages.
- User-friendly interface with a professional design.

---
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database
- Django 5.1.4
- `pip` package manager
- **Visual C++ Build Tools** (for `cryptography` library): Download and install from [Microsoft's website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

---
## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-message-system.git
cd django-message-system
```

### Setup Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
### Database Configuration
1. Create a PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE message_system;
   CREATE USER sender_user WITH PASSWORD 'sender123';
   CREATE USER receiver_user WITH PASSWORD 'receiver123';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE message_system TO sender_user, receiver_user;
   ```

2. Update database credentials in `SenderProject/settings.py` and `ReceiverProject/settings.py`.

### Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create Superuser (Optional)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---
### Setup Media Folder for Attachments
1. Ensure `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` are properly configured in both projects' `settings.py`:
   ```python
   import os

   MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
   MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
   ```

2. Update `urls.py` to serve media files during development:
   ```python
   from django.conf import settings
   from django.conf.urls.static import static

   urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
   ```

3. Create the `media` folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir media
   ```

4. On Windows, set the correct permissions using:
   ```bash
   icacls media /grant Everyone:(F) /T
   ```

---
### Run the Development Server
- Start the `SenderApp`:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver 8000
  ```
- Start the `ReceiverApp`:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver 8001
  ```

---
## Usage

### SenderApp
- Access the `SenderApp` at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
- Register or log in to send messages.
- Attach files (up to 5 MB) if necessary.
- Messages are encrypted and forwarded to the `ReceiverApp`.

### ReceiverApp
- Access the `ReceiverApp` at `http://127.0.0.1:8001/`.
- Log in to view received messages.
- Search, filter, and sort messages with a clean interface.
- Download attached files.

## Security Features
- Encrypted messages using `Fernet` symmetric encryption.
- Secure password hashing with Django's default hasher.
- Permissions and roles configured in the database.

---
## Known Issues
- Ensure both apps are running on their respective ports (8000 for `SenderApp`, 8001 for `ReceiverApp`).
- Attachments larger than 5 MB are not supported.
